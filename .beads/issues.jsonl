{"id":"pb0-astro-seq","title":"Plan testing strategy for pb0-astro","description":"Think through and plan the testing approach for the site. Consider: visual regression testing (screenshots/Playwright), accessibility testing (contrast, keyboard nav), cross-browser/device testing, dark mode coverage, interactive component testing (Nessie, Rotating Links, etc.), and build/deploy validation. Produce a concrete testing plan.","notes":"# Testing Strategy for pb0-astro\n\n## Current State\n- 0 tests, 0 test deps, 0 CI\n- 31 React components (9 p5.js canvas, 3 SVG puzzles, shared UI)\n- 37 pages (20 interactive, 65 content collection entries)\n- Dark mode: class-based with localStorage + p5.js MutationObserver\n- A11y: minimal (some aria-labels, no keyboard nav in puzzles)\n\n## Recommended Stack\n- **Vitest** — unit + component tests (native Astro/Vite integration)\n- **Playwright** — E2E, visual regression, a11y audits (already available via MCP)\n- **axe-core** — accessibility scanning (via @axe-core/playwright)\n\n## Testing Layers (priority order)\n\n### 1. Unit Tests (Vitest) — highest ROI\nTarget: pure logic modules with complex math\n- nessiesLogic.ts (tile geometry, overlap detection, attachment computation)\n- celticKnotsLogic.ts (grid state, tile placement rules)\n- cipraLogic.ts (loop puzzle logic)\n- parseIntList.ts, playingCard.ts utilities\n- darkMode.ts (inDarkMode, color helpers)\n\nWhy first: these are the most bug-prone, easiest to test, and cheapest to run.\n\n### 2. Component Tests (Vitest + React Testing Library)\nTarget: interactive UI controls\n- NumberInputRow — clamp behavior, change callbacks\n- TurnToggleRow — L/R state, click handlers\n- Button, Input, Slider — props, disabled states\n- ShapeDesignPanel — control point updates\n\nWhy: validates UI behavior without full browser, fast feedback loop.\n\n### 3. E2E Tests (Playwright)\nTarget: full-page interactive flows\n- Nessie puzzle: place tile → undo → reset → edit shape modal\n- Celtic Knots: tile placement → rotation → undo\n- Rotating Links: toggle buttons, number inputs, animation rendering\n- Theme toggle: click → persists across reload\n- Content pages: blog posts render, product pages render, navigation works\n\n### 4. Visual Regression (Playwright screenshots)\nTarget: catch unintended layout changes\n- Each puzzle page (light + dark mode)\n- Animations landing page\n- Cherry Arbor Design product grid\n- Header/nav at multiple viewports (mobile, tablet, desktop)\n\nApproach: baseline screenshots committed to repo, CI compares on PRs.\n\n### 5. Accessibility Audits (axe-core + Playwright)\nTarget: all pages, both themes\n- Run axe scan on every page route\n- Flag contrast issues in dark mode\n- Identify missing ARIA labels on interactive SVG/canvas\n- Keyboard navigation: tab order, focus indicators on puzzles\n\n## Setup Steps (implementation issues to create)\n\n1. **Install test deps**: vitest, @testing-library/react, jsdom, playwright, @axe-core/playwright\n2. **Add vitest.config.ts** + test script in package.json\n3. **Write unit tests** for logic modules (nessiesLogic, celticKnotsLogic, cipraLogic)\n4. **Write component tests** for shared controls\n5. **Add playwright.config.ts** + E2E test scaffolding\n6. **Write E2E tests** for puzzle interactions + theme toggle\n7. **Add visual regression** baseline screenshots\n8. **Add a11y audit** script that scans all routes\n9. **Set up GitHub Actions** CI to run tests on push/PR\n\n## What NOT to test (diminishing returns)\n- p5.js canvas pixel output (too brittle, use visual regression instead)\n- Scratch iframe embeds (SpaceRocks — external dependency)\n- Static MDX prose content (build success is sufficient)\n- Astro internals / content collection schema (framework-level)\n\n## Estimated effort\n- Layer 1 (unit): ~2 sessions\n- Layer 2 (component): ~1 session\n- Layer 3 (E2E): ~2 sessions\n- Layer 4 (visual): ~1 session\n- Layer 5 (a11y): ~1 session\n- CI setup: ~1 session","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"pbenson@me.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T00:50:40.444547-05:00","created_by":"Pete Benson","updated_at":"2026-02-15T01:10:27.374511-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-15T01:10:27.374511-05:00","close_reason":"Testing strategy planned — see notes for full plan"}
