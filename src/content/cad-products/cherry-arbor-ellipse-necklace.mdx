This tile has taken the math community by storm.Learn about the exciting recent discoveries of the Hat (also known as the “einstein tile”) and its close relative, the Spectre.  The Hat is the first-ever shape in mathematics to tile the plane endlessly without ever quite repeating the pattern- this is called an aperiodic tiling. Your kit contains  80 plus wooden pieces in 4 different colors and a 12 page educational booklet.

based on the Einstein Tile discovered by David Smith, Joseph Samuel Myers, Craig S. Kaplan, and Chaim Goodman-Strauss
