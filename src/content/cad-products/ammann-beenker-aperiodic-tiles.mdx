Ammann-Beenker tiles
are another set of tiles with the amazing property of aperiodicity: while you can tile an infinite plane with these tiles, you cannot do so with a repeating, wall-paper like pattern. The magnetic tiles stay put, at least until you find yourself in a dead end, and have to rearrange the tiles to keep going. Try to create a tiling using all the tiles, without leaving any holes.
