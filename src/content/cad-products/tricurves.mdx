The Tricurve puzzle was recommended to us by Tim Lexen. It is made in our Ann Arbor studio. The Tricurve puzzle is formed from segments of an arc of a circle and to create this unique shape and that flows together in an airy kind of way. These tiles come in two shades of purple, and natural birch, finished on both sides, because the tiles can be combined regardless of orientation.

Your bucket will be filled with 66 wood pieces cut from Baltic birch, and comes with a 12 page educational booklet.
