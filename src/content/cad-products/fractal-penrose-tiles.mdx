These tiles combine the chaotic boundary of fractals with the non-repeating characteristics of Penrose tilings. For more details, you can read our Fractal Penrose blog post.

Your bucket, small box, or large box will be filled with wood pieces cut from Baltic birch. A small 8-page booklet tells the story of your puzzle.
