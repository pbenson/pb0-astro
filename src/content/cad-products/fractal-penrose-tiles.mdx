These tiles combine the chaotic boundary of fractals with the non-repeating characteristics of Penrose tilings. For more details, you can read ourFractal Penrose blog post.

Yourbucket, small box, or large boxwill be filled with wood pieces cut from Baltic birch. A small 8-page booklet tells the story of your puzzle.
