This set of tiles is based on the Terdragon curve described by Donald Knuth and Chandler Davis. Like the Koch Snowflake tiles, each tile is a scaled copy of the other tiles. Any two tiles can be connected, regardless of size difference. A tile can be replicated from 3 smaller tiles, which means the dragon is a rep-tile (no, we didn’t make that up!)

Your bucket or box will be filled with wood pieces cut from Baltic birch. We have updated our booklets- they are now wire bound 12 page booklets. Each bucket has 75+ pieces- 3 different sizes and 5 colors.
