Our Socolar–Taylor tiles are aperiodic, so no matter how hard you try, the tiles refuse to allow a wallpaper like pattern of repetition. Amazingly, these tiles are aperiodic even though they all have the same shape! Our other aperiodic tiles, such as Roger Penrose's P2 and P3, Robert Ammann's Golden B and Ammann-Beenker, and Thurston, Bandt, and Gummelt's Fractal Penrose, all require two tile shapes.

Comes in a clear bucket with 61 tiles that you can put together as a large hexagon, or in whatever shape you wish. Also includes a wire-bound educational booklet.
