OurSocolar–Taylortiles are aperiodic, so no matter how hard you try, the tiles refuse to allow a wallpaper like pattern of repetition. Amazingly, these tiles are aperiodic even though they all have the same shape! Our other aperiodic tiles, such as Roger Penrose'sP2andP3,Robert Ammann'sGolden BandAmmann-Beenker, and Thurston, Bandt, and Gummelt'sFractal Penrose, all require two tile shapes.

Comes in a clear bucket with 61 tiles that you can put together as a large hexagon, or in whatever shape you wish. Also includes a wire-bound educational booklet.
