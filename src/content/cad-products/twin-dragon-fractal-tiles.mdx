description: "The Twin Dragon is a fractal, composed from two identical skinny Heighway dragons, each made of an infinitely long space-filling path. We worked with the mathematician Dylan Thurston to construct these pieces. Twin dragons have infinitely long edges, and any two pieces can be fit together many ways."

The Twin Dragon is a fractal, composed from two identical skinny Heighway dragons, each made of an infinitely long space-filling path. We worked with the mathematician Dylan Thurston to construct these pieces. Twin dragons have infinitely long edges, and any two pieces can be fit together many ways.

Your bucket or small box will be filled with wood pieces cut from Baltic birch. A 12 page booklet gets you started exploring these amazing tiles. Small box size is 4.5″ x 4.5″ x 4.5″  with 60 pieces and has a Twin Dragon etched lid. Bucket is 5′ x 4″ x 4″ and has 55 pieces.
