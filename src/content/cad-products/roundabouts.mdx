There are 13 unique roundabout tiles, and each has a duplicate. The 26 tiles can be used to solve a number of puzzles, ranging from simple to extremely difficult. Each puzzle is a map outline that shows only where a tiles belong, but does not tell you which of the tiles are needed to make the map. You can also create your own puzzles simply by trying to create new maps that are not among the 15 puzzles that are described in the accompanying booklet.
