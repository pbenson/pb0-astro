This tile has taken the math community by storm.Learn about the exciting recent discoveries of the Einstein Tile called the Turtle.  The turtle is a close relative of the Hat-the first-ever shape in mathematics to tile the plane endlessly without ever quite repeating the pattern- this is called an aperiodic tiling. Your kit contains  60 plus wooden pieces in 3 different colors - turtle hatch scoring is on both sides of each tile and a 12 page educational booklet.

based on the Einstein Tile discovered by David Smith, Joseph Samuel Myers, Craig S. Kaplan, and Chaim Goodman-Strauss
