These tiles were discovered by Roger Penrose, who is well-known as a physicist who collaborated with Stephen Hawking. Penrose was interested in the problem of finding a set of tiles that only tile the plane aperiodically. This means they aren’t like wallpaper, or typical tiling patterns. Looking at wallpaper, you can move to a new position, and the wallpaper looks the same in all directions. Penrose’s tilings require that the pattern always looks different if you move to a new point. This is the second of the three Penrose tilings.

Your bucket or small box will be filled with wood pieces cut from Baltic birch. A 12-page wirebound booklet tells the story of your puzzle.

We also offer the extra large P2 Classroom Kit.
