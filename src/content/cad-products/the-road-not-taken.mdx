The reflective poem by Robert Frost,The Road Not Taken.  The shape of the space filling curve allows for a decidedly geometric interpretation of this beautiful poem.  Two paths begin in the middle of the curve and end in different locations and the curved paths highlight the differences and the similarities of different decisions.

The Road Not Taken is etched into 1/4" inch baltic birch and cut in the shape of a space filling curve and surrounded by a yellow wood of fractal trees.  The Poem is attached to a black background 12 inches in diameter and .25 inches thick.
