Johannes Kepler studied tesselations, and was particularly interested in the negative spaces that appeared in the patterns that could be created with pentagons. Explore patterns of your own with this set of Kepler's pentagon tiles. Puzzle pieces and box and lid are made from baltic birch.

Your bucket, small box, or large box will be filled with wood pieces cut from Baltic birch. A small 8-page booklet gives a description of your puzzle.
