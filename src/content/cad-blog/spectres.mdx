At [Cherry Arbor Design](https://cherryarbordesign.com/), my wife and I create a lot of tilings. Some allow periodic tilings. Others are [aperiodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperiodic_tiling), and can’t repeat like wallpaper. Part of the appeal of [aperiodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperiodic_tiling) tiles is that on first encounter, it is remarkably difficult to tesselate without hitting a dead end, making them a kind of puzzle. We’ve made [aperiodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperiodic_tiling) [Penrose tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling), Fractal [Penrose tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling), the [Golden B](https://cherryarbordesign.com/blogs/news/golden-b-aperiodic-with-one-shape?_pos=1&_sid=62cbd563b&_ss=r), and [Ammann-Beenker](https://cherryarbordesign.com/blogs/news/ammann-beenker-might-drive-you-bonkers?_pos=1&_sid=3d9d0bbda&_ss=r) tiles.

Aperiodic tilings were discovered in the 1960s. The first [aperiodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperiodic_tiling) tiling used over 20,000 different tile shapes. This number was reduced rapidly. By 1970, there were examples of tilings that required only two shapes. Was there a tile that only required one shape? That remained unanswered until 2023, when [David Smith et al](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/01/science/puzzles-mathematics-tiling.html?unlocked_article_code=1.C00.Otaw.n3W0ddiN2XdT&hpgrp=c-abar&smid=url-share) published a description of an [aperiodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperiodic_tiling) tile. In fact, [they described several variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17743). One in particular has drawn attention because unlike most [aperiodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperiodic_tiling) tilings, it does not allow flipping the tiles over. It is called the Spectre. You can modify the edge of the Specter tile, and as long as the edge does not cross itself, it is an [aperiodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperiodic_tiling) monotile. So you can create your own!
