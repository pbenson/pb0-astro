Heidi and I started our business in early 2017, and had our first show in July of that year in Charlevoix, Michigan. At the time, it was hard to imagine we would be able to show in Ann Arbor a year later. But there we were: Heidi had whipped us into shape doing about one show every month, and we made it into the State Street Art Fair, one of the four fairs that comprise the Ann Arbor Art Fair. It was great to be in our hometown and see familiar faces in the crowd.

We did three[American Craft Council](https://craftcouncil.org/)shows earlier in the year, and we always have other artists stopping by and showing interest in our decorative shapes, such as these:

[Loren Maron](https://www.lorenmaron.com/)was one of those artists. She creates beautiful ceramic trays. When we saw her in Ann Arbor, we were delighted to see examples of her work that incorporated elements of our designs. Below is one of her trays using the design we callCells.

My favorite part of every show is watching folks get hands on with our work:
