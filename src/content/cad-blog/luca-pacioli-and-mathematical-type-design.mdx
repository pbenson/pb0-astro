We've been taking typography classes at our nearby community college. Type design necessarily consists of line and curve, but some type faces such as [Futura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)) are explicitly geometric.

When movable type appeared in Europe (400 years after it appeared in Asia), humanist type designers such as [Nicolas Jensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Jenson) wanted to improve upon the heavy, difficult-to-read calligraphic [Blackletter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter). Returning from a visit to Italy where he studied the Latin typefaces carved by the Romans, Jensen developed a typeface that was readable, yet retained the look of the human hand wielding a [broad nibbed pen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nib_(pen)).

[Luca Pacioli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Pacioli), collaborating with his mathematics student (and housemate) Leonardo da Vinci, studied the stroke widths and curvature of this humanist type, and captured it in his [famous series of uppercase letters](https://www.google.com/search?q=luca+pacioli+type&tbm=isch&source=lnt&tbs=isz:lt,islt:4mp&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-5_nsrdTeAhVI1IMKHc1LDPsQpwUIJQ&biw=1112&bih=638&dpr=2). Besides being beautiful graphic art, we like how it illustrates geometry at work.
