The[Apollonian gasket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket)is a fractal. It begins with three circles. Each pair of circles touch each other at a single point, and the three points of contact are distinct.

There are two circles that just touch all three:

Since we have added new tangent circles, we can now take new combinations of circles three at a time that are mutually touching, and find the two circles that touch all three. We continue this, filling in the empty spaces, and creating the [Apollonian gasket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket). The circles invite decoration with colors or depth.

There are also interesting relationships between the curvature of the circles. A circle's curvature gets bigger as the circle gets smaller. If it has radius 1, the curvature is 1. If the radius is 1/3, the curvature is 3. And so on. Here is an [Apollonian gasket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket) showing the curvature of each circle. If you start at the 2 on the left, and follow the circles around the 3, the numbers are 2, 6, 14,.... Do you see a pattern?

And here is an example of an [Apollonian gasket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket) we've made.

If you're curious about the name,[Apollonius of Perga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga), the great Greek geometer, solved the[more general problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_Apollonius)of finding tangents for three circles that aren't necessarily touching. In that case, there can be up to eight tangent circles.
