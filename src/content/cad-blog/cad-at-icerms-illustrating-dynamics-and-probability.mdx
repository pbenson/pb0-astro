We had a great experience in November 2019 at [ICERM](https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-f19/w3/), meeting and collaborating with other artists, mathematicians, and craftspeople. Below is the landing page we used....

Cherry Arbor Design was founded by Heidi Robb and Pete Benson in 2017. We make pieces that encourage mathematical inquiry by exploiting artistic play as a hook into deeper study. In two dimensions, we use tilings and dissections to learn about geometry, tessellations, fractals, golden ratio themes, and knots. We recently began investigating 3D. Related work:

Simple tiles that permit interesting nonperiodic tilings, such as [Nessie](https://cherry-arbor-design.myshopify.com/blogs/news/nessie-the-sea-serpent-tile) and Tim Lexen's [tricurve](https://cherry-arbor-design.myshopify.com/blogs/news/lexens-tricurve-a-curvy-triangle-from-a-semicircle)

Fractal tilings yielding interesting nonperiodic tilings, such as [Terdragon](https://cherry-arbor-design.myshopify.com/blogs/news/here-be-dragons), [Twin Dragon](https://cherry-arbor-design.myshopify.com/blogs/news/tesselating-twin-dragons), and [Koch snowflake](https://cherry-arbor-design.myshopify.com/blogs/news/koch-snowflakes)
