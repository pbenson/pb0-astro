# Cipra Loops

Barry Cipra is inspired by the work of [Sol Lewitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt), who often explored the possible combinations of a graphic idea. For these tiles, that graphic idea is that every edge has two paths that must lead to an adjacent edge. The tiles are oriented, and this means there are exactly 16 possible tiles.
