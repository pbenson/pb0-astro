# Nessies

A whimsical tiling puzzle inspired by Loch Ness. The "Nessie" is a monotile - a single tile shape that can tile the plane aperiodically.

## The Tile Shape

The Nessie tile is a parallelogram with:
- 2:1 side ratio (long edge is twice the short edge)
- 60° and 120° interior angles
- 6 edge segments labeled alternating A and B

## The Rules

Tiles connect when an **A** segment meets a **B** segment. The edges must align perfectly - matching segment types is not enough.

Click an edge segment to see possible tile placements, use **arrow keys** to cycle through options, and press **Enter** to place. Click **Edit Shape** to customize the tile's curves.
