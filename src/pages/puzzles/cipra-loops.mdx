# Cipra Loops

A puzzle based on Barry Cipra's loop-tracing tiles. Each tile has 4 curved paths connecting 8 endpoints on its edges. When tiles are arranged in a 4×4 grid on a torus (edges wrap around), the paths form closed loops.

## How to Play

- Click a tile to select it, then click another to swap them
- Click "Shuffle" to randomize all tiles
- Click a loop number to highlight that loop
- Try to minimize the number of loops!
