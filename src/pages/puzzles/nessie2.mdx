# Nessie 2

A generalized tiling puzzle with different polygon shapes. Each shape is defined by a turn sequence (multiples of 60°).

## How It Works

Choose a polygon shape to start. Each shape has edges labeled alternating **A** and **B**. Tiles connect when an **A** segment meets a **B** segment.

## Controls

- Click an edge to see possible tile placements
- Use **arrow keys** to cycle through placement options
- Press **Enter** to place the tile
- Click **Edit Shape** to customize the tile's curves
