# The Spectre Monotile

The Spectre is an aperiodic monotile discovered in 2023. It can tile the plane, but only non-periodically - no translation will map the tiling onto itself.

## Interactive Shape Designer

Drag the red and blue control points to curve the edges. The same curve is applied to all 14 edges, alternating between the curve and its reflection.

## Properties

- 14 equal-length edges
- All edge curves are congruent (same shape, some reflected)
- Can tile the plane without gaps or overlaps
- The tiling is necessarily aperiodic
