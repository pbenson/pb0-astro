# Rotating Links

This sketch explores the idea of an anchored point, with a series of linked line segments. If we imbue each link with a length, a direction to rotate, and a rate of rotation that is relative to the rotation of the preceding link, the links take on a interesting motion.

This has literally several moving parts. So we started simply, with a single segment, rotating in one direction. That wasn't very interesting to look at, so we won't show that one. Next…

## Vary the number and rotation direction

Enter the letters R (right for clockwise rotation) or L (left for counterclockwise rotation).

<FixedLengthSegments client:load initialTurns="LRL" />

Enter the letters R (right for clockwise rotation) or L (left for counterclockwise rotation), and the corresponding link lengths as a comma-delimited list of integers.

<VariableLengthSegments client:load initialTurns="RRR" initialLengths="2,1,4" />

## Vary the segment rotation rates

Enter the letters R (right for clockwise rotation) or L (left for counterclockwise rotation), the corresponding link lengths as a comma-delimited list of integers, and comma-delimited list of relative rotation rates for each link.

<VariableLengthAndRotation client:load initialTurns="LRR" initialLengths="1,2,3" initialRotations="3,1,3" />
