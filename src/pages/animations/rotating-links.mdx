# Rotating Links

This sketch explores the idea of an anchored point, with a series of linked line segments. If we imbue each link with a length, a direction to rotate, and a rate of rotation that is relative to the rotation of the preceding link, the links take on an interesting motion.

This has literally several moving parts, so we'll build up one parameter at a time.

## Rotation direction

Each segment rotates either left (counterclockwise) or right (clockwise). Toggle the buttons below to set the direction for each segment, and use **+** and **×** to add or remove segments.

<FixedLengthSegments client:load initialTurns="LRL" />

## Add variable lengths

Now each segment also has its own length. Try changing the values to see how different proportions affect the motion.

<VariableLengthSegments client:load initialTurns="RRR" initialLengths="2,1,4" />

## Add variable rotation rates

Finally, each segment can rotate at a different rate relative to the one before it. Higher numbers mean faster rotation.

<VariableLengthAndRotation client:load initialTurns="LRR" initialLengths="1,2,3" initialRotations="3,1,3" />
